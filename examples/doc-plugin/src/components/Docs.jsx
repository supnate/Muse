        Muse is a micro-frontends solution that allows to break a large application into small parts
        in a loose-coupled architecture. In Muse, these small parts are plugins, they can be
        developed, tested, built and deployed independently.
      </p>
      <h2>About This Demo App</h2>
      <p>
        This simple demo app mainly consists of two features as plugins: user info managment and
        roles management. Below images shows the seamless interaction between the two plugins:{' '}
        <b>users-plugin</b> renders a list to show all users, and <b>roles-plugin</b> contributes a{' '}
        <b>Role</b> column to it besides its own pages.
      </p>
      <img src={museDemo} alt="muse-demo" width="700px" className="doc-img" />
      <p>
        Also, there are some other demo purpose features which are also implemented as plugins, for
        example: <b>demo-controller-plugin</b> to control which plugins should be loaded,{' '}
        <b>doc-plugin</b> for documentation, etc. The demo app shows the basic thought about how to
        create an app with Muse. You can see the full list of plugins in the bottom of this page.
      </p>
      <h2>Thinking in Muse</h2>
      <p>
        To help you understand how Mues works, we created this demo app. Below is the story about
        how we created this demo app in the Muse way:
      </p>
      <Timeline
        items={[
          {
            children: (
              <>
                Finally we got to the last step of open sourcing Muse: creating a demo application! We
                decided to create a user managment application. First, we created a new Muse app and
                deployed <b>@ebay/muse-boot-default</b> plugin to it as the boot plugin.
              </>
            ),
          },
          {
            children: (
              <>
                We decided to use React UI framework and ant.design as the UI library: so we deployed two
                library plugins <b>@ebay/muse-lib-react</b> and <b>@ebay/muse-lib-antd</b> to the app.
                They can provide shared modules at run time.
              </>
            ),
          },
          {
            children: (
              <>
                We needed a global layout with header and sider, instead of creating a new one from
                scratch, we decided to use <b>@ebay/muse-layout-antd</b> plugin. So we also deployed it to
                the app.
              </>
            ),
          },
        ]}
      />
      <DocTip>
        Recap: rather than creating an app from scratch, you can use existing Muse plugins to
        initialize a Muse app. The reusable plugins could be a boot plugin to load other plugins, a
        lib plugin to provide shared modules (like React, Redux, Components Library, etc), or a
        normal plugin to provide some functionality.
      </DocTip>
      <Timeline
        items={[
          {
            children: (
              <>
                Then we started to create the real feature for the app: user manager. To implement the
                feature, we uses the template from create-react-app:
                <ul>
                  <li>Create a standard React app by create-react-app</li>
                  <li>
                    Run <i>npx muse-setup-cra</i> command to make it a Muse plugin project. It uses{' '}
                    <b>craco</b> to modify the webpack config without ejecting it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Install <b>@ebay/muse-lib-react</b> and <b>@ebay/muse-lib-antd</b> as dependencies so
                    that we can use the shared modules at dev time.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </>
            ),
          },
          {
            children: (
              <>
                Now we got a Muse plugin project, then started to implement user manager features, it
                needs:
                <ul>
                  <li>A list page to show/manage users.</li>
                  <li>A menu item in the sider for navigation.</li>
                </ul>
                In Muse, all code related with one feature is maintained in one project. So we would
                neither add a global routing rule for "/users" somewhere nor change the layout plugin to
                add a new menu item. Instead, we contributed extension points provided by{' '}
                <b>@ebay/muse-lib-react</b> and <b>@ebay/muse-layout-antd</b> plugins for the routing rule
                and menu item from <b>users-plugin</b>:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <Tag>route</Tag>: define a page to show the users list:
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <Tag>museLayout.sider.getItems</Tag>: a menu item in the sider for navigation.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </>
            ),
          },
          {
            children: (
              <>
                After we finished the basic users profile management feature, our product manager asks to
                add a new feature: roles management. That is allow to assign a user some role for backend
                permissions check.
              </>
            ),
          },
          {
            children: (
              <>
                Thinking in Muse, instead of change users plugin's code, we created a new plugin named{' '}
                <b>roles-plugin</b> for roles management. Similar with <b>users-plugin</b> it also use
                below extension points to define a page and a menu item:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <Tag>route</Tag>: define a page to show the roles list:
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <Tag>museLayout.sider.getItems</Tag>: a menu item in the sider for navigation.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </>
            ),
          },
          {
            children: (
              <>
                Now we also have roles management in the app, however, we need to show roles in the users
                list page and also in the user edit modal we need to allow to select a role. So, we need
                to make <b>users-plugin</b> extensible first. That is, define two extension points in
                users plugin:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <Tag>userList.columns.getColumns</Tag>: allow other plugins to provide additional
                    columns in the users list page.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <Tag>userInfo.fields.getFields</Tag>: allow other plugins to provide additional fields
                    in the user info edit modal.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </>
            ),
          },
          {
            children: (
              <>
                After the `users-plugin` had provided extension points, we updated roles-plugin to
                contribute to those two extension points:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <Tag>userList.columns.getColumns</Tag>: add a new role column to show the users list
                    page.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <Tag>userInfo.fields.getFields</Tag>: add a new select widget in the user edit form to
                    allow select a role for the user.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                Then we finished roles management feature and enhanced user's management to support role
                property in user's profile.
              </>
            ),
          },
        ]}
      />

      <DocTip className="small">
        Recap: in Muse we create an application feature by feature, so that when adding more and
        more functaionalities, the whole application will not be more and more complicated. Since
        each plugin is built on top of common shared modules, every plugin project can be small and
        easy to maintain. Also, you have a first glance about the extension point mechanism, it's a
        core concept in Muse too which helps to allow different plugins work together seamlessly.

                Again, our product manager thought there should be a dashboard as homepage to show the
                insight of the current system. Then the question is: where should we implement the
                dashboard? Before Muse, when we add more and more features to an application, the code
                repo becomes more and more complicated. But now with Muse, we can use a plugin again. Muse
                already provides a reusable dashboard pluin <b>@ebay/muse-dashboard</b>, since it's also
                built on top of <b>@ebay/muse-lib-react</b> and <b>@ebay/muse-lib-antd</b>, we can deploy
                it to our app directly. The dashboard plugin not only provides a dashboard component for
                other plugins to use but also provide extension points for other plugins to contribute
                widgets.
              </>
            ),
          },
          {
            children: (
              <>
                So, after we deployed @ebay/muse-dashboard plugin to the app, then we start to use below
                extension point in both <b>users-plugin</b> and <b>roles-plugin</b>:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <Tag>museDashborad.widget.getWidgets</Tag>: define a widget to be added in the
                    dashboard.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <Tag>museDashborad.widget.getCategories</Tag>: define new categories in the
                    dashboard's widget explorer.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                Based on the requriment, we created widgets <b>UsersCountWidget</b>,{' '}
                <b>CreateUserWidget</b>, <b>RolesCountWidget</b>, <b>CreateRoleWidget</b>
                from our plugins and now they can be added to the dashboard. You can see the available
                widgets for dashboard by click <b>Edit Dashboard</b> button on the homepage.
              </>
            ),
          },
          {
            children: (
              <>
                Since we've finished the main demo app, we wanted to add some other features to show
                Muse's plugin system, so we also created below plugins for the demo app:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>demo-init-plugin</b>: read config from session storage to exclude some plugins to
                    be loaded.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>demo-controller-plugin</b>: provides plugins selector, both from a header menu or a
                    dashboard widget.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>docs-plugin</b>: provides this doc page and a welcome widget in the dashboard.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                You can see the full list of plugins deployed on this demo app below.
              </>
            ),
          },
        ]}
      />
      <DocTip>
        Recap: the dashboard plugin is a highly extensible plugin, the usage here shows the
        capability to export assets from a plugin at run time (providing a <b>Dashboard</b> plugin)
        and extension points for other plugins to contribute widgets to the dashboard. It uses local
        storage for data persistent by default but you can also define your own storage provider.

      <h2>Code Sample</h2>
      <p>
        You may have been curious about how <b>users-plugin</b> and <b>roles-plugin</b> work
        together based on the extension point mechanism. Below is the core logic from the two
        plugins. In <b>users-plugin</b>, we defined an extension point named{' '}
        <Tag>userList.columns.getColumns</Tag> to allow other plugins to contribute columns, and in{' '}
        <b>roles-plugin</b> we construct the plugin object to contribute to the extension point.

      <h2>Understanding Muse App and Muse Plugin</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Muse App</b>: a Muse app mainly is a group of plugins. Also, you can provide
          configurations at app level to be consumed by some plugins. When load a Muse app, it means
          load the plugins into the page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Muse Plugin</b>: a Muse plugin is just a normal javascript object which is registered
          to the plugin engine{' '}
          <a href="https://github.com/rekit/js-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            js-plugin
          </a>
          . You can configure any kind of frontend project to build a bundle which registers a
          plugin object. In this example we used create-react-app.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Play with Plugins Selector</h2>
      <div>
        To help explain how plugins work in the demo app, we created a plugins selector plugin on
        the app. It allows to select which plugins are loaded to the page. You can try to disable
        some plugins to see the difference. For example:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Disable <b>users-plugin</b> : there will be not users menu in the left, the users
            related wigets on the dashboard will not be rendered. The <b>roles-plugin</b> can still
            work itself although it contributes content to <b>users-plugins</b> because it doesn't
            hardly depends on <b>users-plugin</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disable <b>@ebay/muse-dashboard</b>: the homepage will show the error. It's because the
            homepage is actually provided by <b>users-plugin</b> which uses Dashboard comomponent
            from dashboard plugin, there's logic in <b>users-plugin</b> to check if dashboard plugin
            exists, if not then shows an error.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disable <b>@ebay/muse-layout</b>: then there's no header nor sider on the page but only
            the main area.

      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>
        From this demo app you should be able to have an overall understanding of Muse. Next you may
        want to try Muse yourself by creating some hello world application. You can just follow the
        get started guide{' '}
        <a href="https://docs.musejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          here
        </a>
        . It will provide a step by step tutorial to create your first Muse application.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there are also many other topics for you to further learning Muse. For example, how
        to build, test, release, deploy a plugin, how to use a remote Muse registry or assets
        storaget, etc. To learn all these topics, you can read detailed documentation{' '}
        <a href="https://docs.musejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">

        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Muse not only provides packages, tools for creating one single application but also provides
        ability to build an enterprise level infrastructure for SPA web applications. You can read

                Same as a normal SPA project, there should be an entry to render the whole application.
                In Muse, you can define an entry function in any plugin (e.g: @ebay/muse-lib-react
                provides the entry function where ReactDOM.render is called). If only one of plugins
                provides the entry function then it will be used by default. But if multiple plugins
                provides entry functions then you need to specify it in app configuration.

                Yes, Muse is not bound to any UI framework. It's based on shared modules and plugin
                mechanism. You can use Muse with any UI framework (or no framework).

              <p>
                From technical perspective, any plugin could be deployed to any application. That is,
                every plugin is reusable. However, to create a plugin publiclly available, you can
                publish the plugin to the npm registry so that others could install and deploy them to
                their applications.

            children: (
              <p>
                Muse plugin's name follows the same pattern as npm. So, you can put scope in the name.
                There are two cases you need to publish a plugin to npm registry:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    It's a library plugin: since it needs to be installed as dependencies of other
                    plugins to provide shared modules at dev time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You want the plugin to be used by others out of your company/organization. So you
                    can distribute it via npm.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            ),

            children: (
              <p>
                No. We've not investigated how much value Muse could bring to server side rendering
                since Muse is only for single page application for now. However, it's something we will
                look at in the future.
